  <center><h1>BILAL GARKO'S EDUCATION JOURNEY</h1></center>
  <p>My name is Bilal Idris Garko, I am a student of computer science at Gombe State University. I started my education journey in 2008 when I was enrolled in nursery school. After which I proceeded to completing my primary education in Darul Arqam Academy Gombe, I proceeded to secondary school in same school somewhere around 2017. In 2022, I completed my secondary education and decided to pursue higher education. I got admitted in Gombe State University in the same year to study computer science. Throughout my education journey, I have gained valuable knowledge and skills that have helped me grow both academically and personally. Am currently in 300L and doing my Industrial Training at PANTAMI DIGITAL AGE TECHNOLOGIES ICT HUB</p>
